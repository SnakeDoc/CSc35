### Computer Science Core 35 - Computer Architecture

A repository of lab projects. Mostly assembly code - GNU Assembly (GAS) which uses AT&T syntax and some Turbo Assembly (TASM) which uses INTEL syntax. 

I prefer the AT&T syntax personally... (although I have a passionate hate for all-things AT&T)

There are also some circuit diagrams (full adders, subtractors, multiplexors, k-maps and truth tables) that nobody will be able to open or use without having LogicWorks - an insanely expensive (but good) circuit diagramming tool that no student would be able to afford.

This repo will be messy, since I don't care to keep it clean. There will be both source files, and binaries mixed together. Some instructor samples, and the rest are originals.
